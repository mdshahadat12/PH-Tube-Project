    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2">1. Discuss the scope of Var, Let, and Const</h1>

    <p>Scope is where we can access or use a variable. <br> <br>
        <b>Var scope</b> <br>
        # If you declare a block scope variable with var, it can be accessed from global but if you declare it in a function, it cannot be accessed outside the function, so var is called functional scope. <br> <br>
       
        <b>Let and Const</b> <br>
        # If you declare a variable in block scope and function scope with let or const, it cannot be accessed outside that block and function, so let and constant are called block scope.</p>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2">2. Tell us the use cases of Null, and, Undefined</h1>

    <p>If no value is defined anywhere, it defaults to undefined, which is no value set.  If I am supposed to get something as a value somewhere but I get undefined then no value is set there and if there is no value then I can set it to null that it currently has no value. 
    If there is no value in my mind then it will be null and if there is a value but not set then it will be unfind <br> <br>
    Jhankar Bhai was saying that undefined is like giving a blank exam paper and Null is like giving no paper at all.</p>

    <h1 class="text-xl font-bold my-2">3. What do you mean by REST API?</h1>

    <p>REST full meaning is 'Representational State Transfer' <br>
        REST is API Design Model. This is the most used model for API. This is a way to connect a server.
